        <h2>History of Yoga</h2>
        <p>The term "yoga" first appears in the Katha Upanishad, a Hindu philosophical text dating to around four hundred BC. There, yoga is defined as the technique of using an empty mind and control over one's senses to achieve a state of spiritual enlightenment.  Several other Upanishads over the next few hundred years expand on the concept of yoga, helping to further define the practice as a way to achieve a transcendent spiritual state through the use of techniques such as meditation, mental control, and proper breathing.</p>
        
        <h3>Why is Yoga important?</h3>
        <p>The true essence of Yoga revolves around elevating the life force or 'Kundalini' at the base of the spine. It aims to achieve this through a series of physical and mental exercises. At the physical level, the methods comprise various yoga postures or 'asanas' that aim to keep the body healthy. The mental techniques include breathing exercises or 'pranayama' and meditation or 'dhyana' to discipline the mind.</p>
        <p>The ultimate goal of yoga is, however, to help the individual to transcend the self and attain enlightenment. As the Bhagavad-Gita says, "A person is said to have achieved yoga, the union with the Self, when the perfectly disciplined mind gets freedom from all desires, and becomes absorbed in the Self alone."</p>
        <p>Yoga is not a religion; it is a way of living whose aim is 'a healthy mind in a healthy body'.</p>

        <h3>Yogic exercises recharge the body with cosmic energy. This facilitates:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Attainment of perfect equilibrium and harmony</li>
            <li> Promotes self- healing</li>
            <li> Removes negative blocks from the mind and toxins from the body</li>
            <li> Enhances Personal power</li>
            <li> Increases self-awareness</li>
            <li> Helps in attention focus and concentration</li>
            <li> Reduces stress and tension in the physical body by activating the parasympathetic nervous system</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The aspirant feels rejuvenated and energized. Thus, Yoga bestows upon every aspirant the powers to control body and mind.</p>
